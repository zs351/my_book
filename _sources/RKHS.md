title:      "Part 2: Characterising RKHS with linear operators on Hilbert space"
subtitle:   "In this article, we will see how an RKHS can be constructed by a linear operator on a Hilbert space, which has an important example linking probability and RKHS of stationary kernels, i.e. Bochner's Theorem. For the second part, we will see any complete orthogonal system (CONS) in a separable Hilbert space will give rise to a characterisation of RKHS."

In this article, we will see the characterisation of RKHS as an image space of a linear operator associated with a feature map $\phi: \mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{H}$ on a (separable) Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. The construction of the reproducing kernel from $\phi$ is obvious as shown in [Part 1], however, what is more worthy of presenting is the direct construction of RKHS from a Hilbert space via the linear operator itself. We will show why this view is useful in practice via an import example, which is the Bochner's theorem. For Section 2, we will characterise RKHS with any CONS of the separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$.

In the article, we use $\mathcal{H}$ to denote Hilbert space if without specification; and we use 'linear operator' and 'linear map' interchangeably. The theory can be easily extended to spaces of complex-valued functions, but we here only present the results with real-valued functions for simplicity.

Consider a feature map $\phi : \mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{H}$, then we define a linear operator $L : \mathcal{H}\to \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{X})$ from a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ on $\mathcal{X}$ to the space of all real-valued functions on $\mathcal{X}$, s.t.
